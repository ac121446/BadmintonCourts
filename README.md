BadmintonCourts Web Application

---Explanation of the Software---
This Software is an online booking system that is designed to manage court reservations at SmashRentals. The main sections of my application includes the Home page, Locations, Bookings, Courts, Payments, and Equipments. There is also a pricing page but it is purely for visuals to display the prices. Users are able to easily book courts by choosing a location, 
selecting a court, picking a date and deciding on the start and end times of their booking on the Bookings page. On Locations page, users can filter locations and search by their name to quickly find on in their locations. Admins have the ability to view all the pages including Courts, Payments and Equipment as the user is unable to these ones. They can also 
possess the authority to add, update or remove all these records.Regular users have access to view their own Bookings and all available locations. They can also manage their own bookings and view details of locations. They can create and delete their own bookings. Overall ht eapplication provides a user friendly platform for both customers and administrators 
to book and mange badminton courts efficiently.
